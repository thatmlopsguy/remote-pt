I want to add <COMPANY_NAME> to the listing with the following URL <JOBS_URL>.

I know about these job offerings because (choose one):

- [ ] I work there.
- [ ] I applied there, and they allowed me to share this.
- [ ] A friend works there and says this is correct.
- [ ] Other: (explain briefly here)

I validate the following:

- [ ] The company listed hires in Portugal, without requiring employees to become freelancers/self-employed. The company hires with a legal entity in Portugal, uses an employer of record, or other means.
- [ ] The company offers fully remote positions, where the employee must not visit an office regularly and can work from anywhere in Portugal. Some occasional travel is OK.
- [ ] The URL provided shows a list of positions **at any time**.
- [ ] I tag the offer adequately by choosing one of the following tags:
  - [ ] All offers are remote  
     **if the job listing does not offer any indication that all offers are remote, nor marks clearly remote offers**, but all jobs are remote.
  - [ ] All technical offers are remote  
    **if the job listing does not offer any indication that all offers are remote, nor marks clearly remote offers**, but all technical offers are remote.
  - [ ] View individual job offers to check for remote  
     **if the job listing does not offer any indication that all offers are remote, nor marks clearly remote offers**, so you need to check individual offers to see if the position is remote.
