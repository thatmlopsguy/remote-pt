# Building Your Portfolio

Before a company invites you for an interview, your first impression is made through your CV, cover letter, and online presence.

Making sure these elements represent you well is key to securing that initial meeting:

- Creating a clear and concise CV
- Writing a basic outline for your cover letter
- Reviewing and improving your online presence—this could include your **GitHub profile** and **personal website**.
- Creating, completing, or refining your projects in a portfolio format

It’s important to showcase your technical skills before a company reaches out.

Choose a project you’re passionate about so you can discuss it confidently and make a strong impression during interviews.
