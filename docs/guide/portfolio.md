# Building Your Portfolio

Your portfolio is your first impression—often before you ever speak to a company. Make sure your CV, cover letter, and online presence reflect your skills and professionalism.

## Steps to Build a Strong Portfolio

- **Create a clear and concise CV**
- **Write a basic outline for your cover letter**
- **Review and improve your online presence** (e.g., your GitHub profile and personal website)
- **Showcase your projects** in a portfolio format

Choose a project you’re passionate about so you can discuss it confidently and make a strong impression during interviews.

## Create a Professional CV/Resume with LaTeX

For a polished and professional CV, consider using LaTeX. LaTeX produces high-quality, consistent documents and is widely used in academia and tech.

I recommend the [sb2nov/resume template](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume), which is open-source and highly customizable.

**How to get started:**

1. Visit the [sb2nov/resume GitHub repository](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume)
2. Follow the instructions to set up and edit your CV using LaTeX
3. Export your CV as a PDF to share with employers

If you’re new to LaTeX, there are online editors like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) that make it easy to get started without installing anything.

Investing time in your portfolio and CV will help you stand out and increase your chances of landing interviews.
