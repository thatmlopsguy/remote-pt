# Preparing for Your Job Search

Before you start applying for jobs, it’s important to take a few key steps to set yourself up for success.

## Understand the Job Search Process

Searching for a new role requires focused time and effort. You’ll need to fill out applications, prepare for and attend interviews, complete technical assessments, and make important decisions about your next steps.

Don’t forget to account for the time needed to update your CV, cover letter, portfolio, or website, and to research companies and roles that interest you.

The job search can take several months, so be sure to set aside time for interviews, assessments, and possibly office visits.

## Set Your Job Search Goals and Priorities

Setting clear goals gives your job search direction and helps you track your progress. If you’re changing jobs, goal-setting can help ensure your next move addresses the reasons you’re leaving your current position and helps you find the right fit.

When setting your goals, consider:

### Salary benchmarking

- Research salary expectations for your role and location using online tools, market reports, and by networking with peers in similar positions.
- Understand what compensation you need for your expenses, hobbies, and savings.

### What matters to you in a job

- Identify your preferred industries, responsibilities, and roles.
- Consider the technologies and tools you want to work with.
- Determine the benefits and growth opportunities you’re seeking.
- Think about the company culture where you’ll thrive.
- Decide if you want to work remotely, commute, or relocate, and what that means for your priorities and any dependents.
- Reflect on what will make a job meaningful for you.

Remember, you’ll be competing with other candidates. Set realistic goals so you don’t miss out on great opportunities.
It’s better to consistently work toward your long-term career objectives and remain adaptable in the short term.

## Using a Goal-Setting Framework

You may find it helpful to use a framework like **SWOT analysis** or **personal OKRs** to clarify your goals and track your progress.

## Choosing Your Job Search Approach

There are several ways to approach your job search, including applying directly to companies, working with recruiters, seeking referrals,
or using job search platforms. You don’t have to stick to just one approach—experiment to find what works best for you.

## Working Remotely for International Companies

If you’re joining a company based in another country, you’ll typically be hired either through the employer’s local entity in your country or via
an **Employer of Record (EOR)** service for tax compliance. This is a standard process to ensure both you and your employer meet legal requirements.
Some well-known EOR providers include:

- [Remote](https://remote.com)
- [Deel](https://deel.com)
- [Payroll](https://payroll.com)
- [Oyster HR](https://oysterhr.com)

If you have any uncertainties about your employment arrangement, don’t hesitate to schedule a conversation with the hiring manager.
Share your questions in advance—sometimes they may need to consult with their EOR partner or other experts to provide accurate answers.
