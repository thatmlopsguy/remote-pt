# Job Search Strategies

Having a strategy for your job search helps you focus your time and energy on the most promising opportunities.

Here are some approaches for common scenarios:

## When You’re Unsure About an Opportunity

If a company prefers a call over answering your questions by message, you might feel uncertain about moving forward.

Whether to proceed depends on your current commitments and priorities. Ask yourself:

- How many other interview processes am I currently involved in?
- Are any of my other opportunities less appealing than this one? If so, it may be worth continuing with this company and closing the loop with the others.
- If I’m employed, what deadlines or responsibilities do I have in the coming weeks?

If you can dedicate two to three hours per week to each interview process, it’s usually worthwhile to take the first interview.
Keep in mind that technical assessments may require additional time.

Consider scheduling a short (15–30 minute) chat with the hiring manager before committing to a full interview.
Use this conversation to clarify the opportunity and decide if you want to proceed.

## Evaluating Opportunities from the First Interview

You don’t always need to complete the entire interview process to know if a job is right for you. Asking targeted questions early on can help you assess alignment with your goals.

**Examples of targeted questions:**

- How does the company benchmark salaries and think about compensation?
- What benefits are offered and how do they impact total compensation?
- What kind of person thrives at the company?
- What programming languages, frameworks, and libraries are used, and why?
- What are the company’s current goals and how does this team contribute?
- How does leadership handle challenges or staff concerns?
- Is there flexibility in terms of work location or remote work?
- What strategies are in place to support remote employees and prevent isolation?
- What’s exciting about the company’s industry?
- For consultancies: Is there flexibility to move to a new project if needed?
- What opportunities exist for career and skill development?
- How can a new hire make a strong impression in the first 3 months?
- What do team members like most and least about their roles?
- What are the company’s biggest financial opportunities and challenges?

After gathering answers, compare them to your job search goals. Watch for any dealbreakers or red flags that might prevent you from accepting an offer.

It’s best to communicate your decision early in the process, rather than waiting until a formal offer stage.

## Managing Multiple Interview Processes

Juggling several interview processes can be challenging. You want to maximize your chances without spreading yourself too thin. Here are some tips:

- Assess how much time you can realistically dedicate to your job search each week, including interviews, assessments, and possible office visits. This could be three or more hours per interview step.
- Once you know your availability, determine how many interview processes you can handle at once.
- After each interview, reflect on your options and rank your opportunities based on your goals and capacity.
- Pause or close the loop with companies that don’t meet your criteria, so you can focus on the most promising roles.

If you need to pause a process to focus elsewhere, be open and honest with the company.

Here’s a template you can use:

!!! Template

    Hello [hiring manager’s name],

    Thank you for the interview yesterday [or your most recent interaction]. I’m excited about [the next step in their process].

    I’m currently struggling to find enough time to prepare for [the next step]. Would it be possible to pause the process and continue from [a specific date you’ll be available]?

    Kind regards,
    
    [Your name]

Some companies may not be able to delay their hiring process for long.

While you might miss out on some opportunities, focusing your efforts on the best matches for your goals is often worthwhile.

If your job search is urgent, consider whether pausing any processes is the right move.
