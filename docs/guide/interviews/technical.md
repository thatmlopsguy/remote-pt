# How to Prepare for the Technical Interviews

Technical interviews are a crucial part of the hiring process, giving you the chance to demonstrate your skills and for companies to assess your fit for the role.
They often influence the salary range and level you’re considered for, so it’s important to approach them strategically.

Types of Technical Interviews:

- Take-home assessment and follow-up interview
- Paired-programming interview
- Live coding interview

Beyond your technical solution, companies evaluate your communication skills, teamwork, and how you approach challenges.
Be proactive in updating the hiring manager, especially if you have questions or anticipate missing a deadline. Clear communication demonstrates professionalism and engagement.

## Preparing for Technical Interviews

- **Practice:** Use platforms like Codewars or LeetCode to practice coding in the relevant tech stack. For paired interviews, practice explaining your thought process out loud with a friend.
- **Be honest:** If you encounter a knowledge gap, acknowledge it and outline how you plan to address it. This shows self-awareness and a willingness to learn.
- **Showcase your learning:** Share personal projects or your GitHub profile, especially work you’re passionate about. This demonstrates initiative and genuine interest.
- **Align with business needs:** Research the company and consider how your skills can help them achieve their goals. Prepare notes to reference during the interview.
- **Stay calm:** Technical interviews can be stressful, but remember they’re also an opportunity for you to assess if the company and role are right for you. Stay positive and use the experience to learn more about your potential responsibilities.
