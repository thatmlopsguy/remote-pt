# How to Prepare for an Initial Interview

## Do Your Research

- Review the company’s website and job description, and your interviewer’s LinkedIn profile.
- Learn about the company’s mission and values.
- Find a project or event the company has been involved in that you can discuss with genuine interest. Showing excitement about the company increases your chances of progressing.
- Take notes on questions you want to ask, interesting points to mention, and possible talking points to connect with the interviewer.

## Prepare Your Questions

- Remember, you’re also interviewing the company. Note down questions that will help you decide if the opportunity is right for you.
- Review the job description and any information from the hiring manager. Identify unclear elements and prepare questions to clarify them.

## Prepare Your Interview Space

- For phone or video interviews, set up a quiet space where you won’t be disturbed. For video calls, ensure your background is tidy and professional.
- Make sure that anyone around you knows that you will need to be uninterrupted and, if possible, use a room that has a door that you can close.
- Make sure you have a glass of water nearby in case your voice gets hoarse or you get a tickle in your throat.
- Connect via ethernet cable for better bandwidth if possible. Close background apps. Test camera/microphone beforehand and log in 5-10 minutes early to verify equipment works.
- Keep a pen and notepad nearby in case there is something important that you need to write down.
- For in-person interviews, consider visiting the location beforehand or plan your route to avoid being late or getting lost.

## Practice Interview Etiquette

- Aim to arrive early for your interview to avoid unexpected delays.
- Choose appropriate attire based on the company’s culture. When in doubt, dress more formally.
- Practice active listening with a friend or colleague. Show you’re engaged by recalling details and adapting your responses.
- Make a positive impression: remember the interviewer’s name, sit upright, make eye contact, and present yourself as humble, friendly, and confident.

## Review Your Experience

- Go through your CV and past projects to refresh your memory.
- Note any skills you’ve developed that are relevant to the role.

## How to Engage in the Interview

Don’t Avoid Questions

If you’re unsure of an answer, don’t just say “I don’t know.” Instead, try:

> “I’m not entirely sure of my answer right now. Can I get back to you by [specific time]?”
>
> “I would need to think about this for a bit. Can I get back to you by [specific time]?”

Ask Questions. Use your research to ask thoughtful questions specific to the company and role.

Refer to your research to highlight what excites you about the company and position.

If audio or video fails during your interview, use the chat function to communicate with the interviewer. 
Always keep your phone nearby as a backup option for continuing the conversation over a regular phone call. 
If you experience any technical difficulties with seeing or hearing the interviewer, don't hesitate to speak
up so the issue can be addressed promptly.

When dealing with unexpected background noise such as sirens or construction, address the interruption professionally
by apologizing for the disturbance. You can ask for a brief pause until the noise subsides, or temporarily mute
your microphone until the noise has stopped.

If you anticipate potential disruptions due to circumstances like school closures or family emergencies, inform the
interviewer at the beginning of the interview. This allows both parties to adjust accordingly and plan for potential
interruptions. When unexpected challenges arise during the interview, remain composed and work collaboratively with
the interviewer to find suitable solutions.

## After the Interview

Take time to reflect on what you learned about the company and the job.
If you’re no longer interested, let the company know promptly to maintain a positive connection.

You don’t have to complete the entire process, but avoid burning bridges.

### How to Withdraw from an Interview Process

Here’s a template you can use:

!!! Template
    Hello [hiring manager’s name],

    Thank you so much for this opportunity. I’ve enjoyed getting to know [company name] and really admire [something the company is doing that resonated with you].
    However, I don’t believe this role aligns with my current goals, so I will not be continuing with the interview process.

    Kind regards,

    [Your name]

You can also mention a specific reason, such as the tech stack or location.

Reflecting after each interview helps you take ownership of your job search and feel more in control.
Employers may not always drive the process, so staying proactive is important.

### Following Up with an Unresponsive Company

If you haven’t heard back after some days (or after the timeframe they gave you), send a follow-up message to stay top of mind and show your interest. 

Here’s a template:

!!! Template
    Hello [hiring manager’s name],

    I enjoyed our interview on [date] and I’m very excited to hear from you. Would you be able to give me an indication of when I can expect feedback? I’d be glad to continue the interview process with [company name].

    Kind regards,

    [Your name]

### How to Close the Loop with an Unresponsive Company

If you haven’t heard back in over two weeks and need to move forward, you can use this message:

!!! Template
    Hello [hiring manager’s name],

    I’ve really enjoyed the interview process so far and would love to continue. Since I haven’t heard back from you in [number of days or weeks], I will focus on other opportunities for now.

    Please let me know if this role reopens, as I’d still love to explore the possibility of working for [company name].

    Kind regards,

    [Your name]

Even if this prompts a response, don’t assume a delay means you’ve been rejected. There may be other reasons for the delay.

Use it as a chance to explore potential issues, but also consider whether similar delays could affect your experience if you join the company.
