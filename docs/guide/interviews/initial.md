# How to Prepare for an Initial Interview

## Do Your Research

- Review the company’s website and job description, and your interviewer’s LinkedIn profile.
- Learn about the company’s mission and values.
- Find a project or event the company has been involved in that you can discuss with genuine interest. Showing excitement about the company increases your chances of progressing.
- Take notes on questions you want to ask, interesting points to mention, and possible talking points to connect with the interviewer.

## Prepare Your Questions

- Remember, you’re also interviewing the company. Note down questions that will help you decide if the opportunity is right for you.
- Review the job description and any information from the hiring manager. Identify unclear elements and prepare questions to clarify them.

## Prepare Your Interview Space

- For phone or video interviews, set up a quiet space where you won’t be disturbed. For video calls, ensure your background is tidy and professional.
- For in-person interviews, consider visiting the location beforehand or plan your route to avoid being late or getting lost.

## Practice Interview Etiquette

- Aim to arrive early for your interview to avoid unexpected delays.
- Choose appropriate attire based on the company’s culture. When in doubt, dress more formally.
- Practice active listening with a friend or colleague. Show you’re engaged by recalling details and adapting your responses.
- Make a positive impression: remember the interviewer’s name, sit upright, make eye contact, and present yourself as humble, friendly, and confident.

## Review Your Experience

- Go through your CV and past projects to refresh your memory.
- Note any skills you’ve developed that are relevant to the role.

## How to Engage in the Interview

Don’t Avoid Questions

If you’re unsure of an answer, don’t just say “I don’t know.” Instead, try:

> “I’m not entirely sure of my answer right now. Can I get back to you by [specific time]?”
>
> “I would need to think about this for a bit. Can I get back to you by [specific time]?”

Ask Questions. Use your research to ask thoughtful questions specific to the company and role.

Refer to your research to highlight what excites you about the company and position.

## After the Interview

Take time to reflect on what you learned about the company and the job.
If you’re no longer interested, let the company know promptly to maintain a positive connection.

You don’t have to complete the entire process, but avoid burning bridges.

### How to Withdraw from an Interview Process

Here’s a template you can use:

!!! Template
    Hello [hiring manager’s name],

    Thank you so much for this opportunity. I’ve enjoyed getting to know [company name] and really admire [something the company is doing that resonated with you].
    However, I don’t believe this role aligns with my current goals, so I will not be continuing with the interview process.

    Kind regards,

    [Your name]

You can also mention a specific reason, such as the tech stack or location.

Reflecting after each interview helps you take ownership of your job search and feel more in control.
Employers may not always drive the process, so staying proactive is important.

### Following Up with an Unresponsive Company

If you haven’t heard back after some days (or after the timeframe they gave you), send a follow-up message to stay top of mind and show your interest. 

Here’s a template:

!!! Template
    Hello [hiring manager’s name],

    I enjoyed our interview on [date] and I’m very excited to hear from you. Would you be able to give me an indication of when I can expect feedback? I’d be glad to continue the interview process with [company name].

    Kind regards,

    [Your name]

### How to Close the Loop with an Unresponsive Company

If you haven’t heard back in over two weeks and need to move forward, you can use this message:

!!! Template
    Hello [hiring manager’s name],

    I’ve really enjoyed the interview process so far and would love to continue. Since I haven’t heard back from you in [number of days or weeks], I will focus on other opportunities for now.

    Please let me know if this role reopens, as I’d still love to explore the possibility of working for [company name].

    Kind regards,

    [Your name]

Even if this prompts a response, don’t assume a delay means you’ve been rejected. There may be other reasons for the delay.

Use it as a chance to explore potential issues, but also consider whether similar delays could affect your experience if you join the company.
