# Job Offers

## Introduction

Reaching the offer stage is exciting, but it can also feel stressful as you wait for final decisions.
Delays are common and often due to internal company processes, not a lack of interest.
The best approach is to stay patient, keep communication open, and use this time to reflect on your priorities and questions.

This section will help you navigate the waiting period and manage multiple offers with confidence.

## How to Follow Up When Awaiting an Offer

Hereâ€™s a template you can use:

!!! Template
    Hello [hiring managerâ€™s name],

    I hope you are well.

    Thank you for the opportunity to interview for this position at [company name]. Iâ€™m even more excited about the possibility of joining your team.

    [Mention something you learned about the company or role that stood out to you.]

    Please let me know if you need any additional information from me. I look forward to your feedback.

    Kind regards,

    [Your name]

## Managing Multiple Processes at Different Stages

Itâ€™s rare for all your interview processes to be at the same stage at the same time.

You want to make informed decisions, but you may need to respond to one offer before hearing back from others.

Keep hiring managers updated on your interest and situation.

If you need to move quickly, hereâ€™s a message you can use:

!!! Template
    Hello [hiring managerâ€™s name],

    I hope you are well.

    Thank you for the process so far. Iâ€™ve really enjoyed learning more about [company name] and am excited about the potential to join your team.

    I wanted to let you know that I have received an offer from another company, but Iâ€™m very interested in [company name] and would like to continue with your process.
    Could you give me an idea of the timeline for the remaining steps so I can update the other company accordingly?

    I look forward to hearing from you.

    Kind regards,

    [Your name]

## How to Request More Time to Decide on an Offer

If you need extra time to consider an offer, communicate openly and express your appreciation. Hereâ€™s a template:

!!! Template
    Hello [hiring managerâ€™s name],

    Thank you again for your generous offer to join [company name]. Iâ€™m thrilled to have received it and have enjoyed the interview process.

    I am currently in the final stages with another company and would like to complete that process before making a final decision. Could you please allow me [your timeframeâ€”ideally a week or less] to provide an answer? I will be sure to get back to you by [date].

    I want to emphasize that I remain genuinely interested in joining your team and am grateful for this opportunity.

    Kind regards,

## Evaluating, Negotiating, and Accepting Job Offers

### Celebrating Your Offer

Congratulationsâ€”youâ€™ve landed a job offer ðŸŽ‰! As soon as you receive the news, thank the hiring manager for the opportunity.
Let them know when youâ€™ll be able to give your answer, and be honest if youâ€™re still completing other interview processes.

Try to confirm your decision within a week.

### Reviewing the Employment Contract

Carefully review every part of the contract before signing. Once signed, you are legally obligated to its terms.
In many countries, **even verbally accepting an offer can be binding**.

Make sure your expectations match whatâ€™s written in the contract. Key elements to check include:

- Salary, bonuses, and total compensation
- How taxes will be handled
- Benefits and leave (including sick leave and legal compliance)
- Job description and responsibilities
- Contract duration
- Working hours and overtime policy
- Probation and notice periods (for both resignation and termination)
- Any non-disclosure or restrictive clauses (e.g., non-compete agreements)

If anything is unclear, arrange a conversation with the hiring manager. Express your excitement about joining, but ask for clarification where needed.

### Deciding Between Multiple Offers

If youâ€™re choosing between two or more offers, consider your future at each company:

- What would your daily life look like at each company? Can you see yourself happy there?
- How would the commute or remote work affect you?
- What is the team like? Can you see yourself working with them?
- How would each job impact your family or partner?
- Can you see yourself staying long-term?
- Which role best supports your career goals, both short- and long-term?

Take your time to reflect and, if needed, use a comparison template to help with your decision.

### Negotiating an Offer

If the offer doesnâ€™t meet your expectations, donâ€™t be discouragedâ€”try to negotiate. Approach negotiations with enthusiasm and a collaborative mindset.
Itâ€™s often best to discuss over a call, but you can start with an email. Hereâ€™s a structure you can use:

**Intro:**

- Express your excitement about the company and the role
- Emphasize why youâ€™re a great fit
- Thank them for the offer

**Body:**

- Mention the specific aspect youâ€™d like to discuss (e.g., salary, signing bonuses, equity)
- Explain why the current offer doesnâ€™t work for you
- Suggest an alternative and provide clear reasoning

**Conclusion:**

- Reiterate the value youâ€™ll bring
- Express your eagerness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement

**Sample negotiation email:**

!!! Template
    Hi [hiring managerâ€™s name],

    Thank you so much for your time and kindness throughout the interview process. Iâ€™m thrilled to have received an offer to join [company name]!
    Iâ€™m very excited about this opportunity, but the only thing holding me back is the remuneration amount.

    I was expecting [desired amount] per year based on [reasons]. Iâ€™d be happy to discuss a compromise that would allow me to fully commit to this opportunity.

    I believe I can add significant value to your team at [company name]. [Share relevant experience or skills]. Iâ€™m a fast learner and motivated to keep growing and contributing to your mission.

    If the offer could be adjusted to [preferred amount], Iâ€™d be ready to accept immediately. Iâ€™d love to discuss this further and am available for a call at [suggest times].

    Kind regards,

    [Your name]

You can adapt this template to negotiate other contract elements as well.

### Accepting an Offer

Once youâ€™ve made your decision, send a message to the hiring manager:

- Thank them for the offer and express your excitement
- Confirm the start date, role title, and compensation
- Ask about next steps and how to prepare

### Rejecting an Offer

If you decide not to accept, respond promptly and professionally:

- Thank them for the opportunity
- Briefly explain your decision
- Express appreciation for the process and team
- Leave the door open for future opportunities

### Closing the Loop with Other Employers

Once youâ€™ve accepted an offer, inform other companies where youâ€™re still in process. Hereâ€™s a template:

!!! Template
    Hi [hiring managerâ€™s name],

    Thank you for the opportunity to interview with [company name]. Iâ€™ve enjoyed getting to know your team and company.

    Iâ€™ve accepted an offer elsewhere and will not be continuing with the process. Should I be in the job market again, Iâ€™ll be sure to reach out.

    Kind regards,

    [Your name]

### Resigning from Your Current Job

When resigning, prepare a thoughtful resignation letter and schedule a meeting with your manager. Be sincere, focus on your future, and offer to help with the transition.
Avoid negative feedback at this stageâ€”save it for an exit interview if appropriate.

### Evaluating a Counteroffer

If your current employer makes a counteroffer, consider your original reasons for leaving. Will staying address those issues? Think about the impact on your relationships with both employers. If you decline, be polite and firm, and leave on good terms. If you accept, make sure it aligns with your long-term goals.

Remember, **accepting an offer is a legal commitment**. If you must renege due to unavoidable circumstances, communicate openly and promptly with the employer, apologize, and thank them for the opportunity.
