While skilled developers remain in demand, the hiring market has cooled since its pandemic peak.
Companies with strong foundations are still recruiting, but they’re doing so more cautiously due to shifting economic conditions.

Competition for roles remains high. You may find yourself interviewing alongside experienced developers who have recently been laid off through no fault of their own.
To stand out, you need to clearly demonstrate how your skills and experience align with a company’s needs—both for the specific role and the organization as a whole.
