## Introduction

Welcome! This repository lists companies that **offer full-time remote tech jobs with Portuguese contracts**.
If you live in Portugal and want to work remotely without the hassle of self-employment, this list is for you.

## Why This List?

While remote work opens global opportunities, Portuguese residents often face challenges when working for foreign companies, such as:

- Needing to become self-employed ("recibos verdes")
- Less job security (contracts can be ended at any time)
- Extra paperwork and tax complexity

This list focuses on companies that hire with **Portuguese full-time contracts**, so you can enjoy the benefits of regular employment
while working remotely from anywhere in Portugal.

## Conditions

**Inclusion criteria:**

- Companies must allow fully remote work from anywhere in Portugal (occasional travel for onboarding/team events is fine)
- Must hire with Portuguese full-time contracts (not self-employment)

Examples:

- Portuguese companies hiring locally with standard contracts
- Foreign companies with a Portuguese legal entity
- Foreign companies using an intermediary, as long as the contract is Portuguese and not freelance/self-employed

## How to Use

1. Browse the [Companies](#companies) section below.
2. Click on "Open positions" to see current job openings.
3. Double-check that the offer is remote and the contract is Portuguese.
4. Explore [Other Job Boards](#other-job-boards) for more opportunities.


## Support

We want this list to stay up-to-date and useful! If you notice outdated info, broken links, or companies that no longer meet the criteria, please [open an issue](https://github.com/thatmlopsguy/remote-pt/issues) or submit a pull request.
