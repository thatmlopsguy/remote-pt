## Introduction

Are you seeking a job?

This is a repository listing companies which **offer full-time remote jobs with Portuguese contracts**.

## Why

When considering a remote job, it's natural to think that you can work for any company in the world.
However, if you live in Portugal, working for companies abroad means becoming self-employed, which has several drawbacks:

* Your employer can end your contract at any time;
* You need to do extra paperwork compared to a regular full-time job;

There is a significant amount of resources to find a remote job, but none targeting people living in Portugal.
The number of companies allowing remote work in Portugal are limited, a list seems a good approach for those seeking a
remote work; they can simply go through the list and look for open positions.

## Conditions

**Only companies which allow working fully remotely** (e.g. you can work from anywhere in Portugal and you do not
have to set foot in an office if you don't want to). Some occasional traveling for onboarding, team building or similar
purposes is fine. Also the companies must also hire people using Portuguese full-time contracts (i.e. not self-employment).
For example, the following scenarios are OK:

* A completely Portuguese company that hires in Portugal with regular, non self-employed contracts people living in Portugal
* A foreign company, with a Portuguese legal entity to be able to hire people living in Portugal, using regular, non 
  self-employed contracts
* A foreign company, using an intermediary to hire people living in Portugal, but the contract must also be Portuguese,
  not requiring self-employment.

## Support

It is our objective for this list to remain useful and effective for job searchers. 
If you use this list and notice that a company listed below is no longer useful (broken URL, not clearly listing remote
offers which fulfill the criteria for the listing, etc.), please send a PR removing it (along with a justification) or 
open an issue.
