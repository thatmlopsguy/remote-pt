# Remote tech jobs in Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

## Introduction

This is a repository listing companies which **offer full-time remote jobs with Portuguese contracts**.

## Why

When considering a remote job, it's natural to think that you can work for any company in the world.
However, if you live in Portugal, working for companies abroad means becoming self-employed, which has several drawbacks:

* Your employer can end your contract at any time;
* You need to do extra paperwork compared to a regular full-time job;

There is a significant amount of resources to find a remote job, but none targeting people living in Portugal.
The number of companies allowing remote work in Portugal are limited, a list seems a good approach for those seeking a
remote work; they can simply go through the list and look for open positions.

## Conditions

### Remote

**Only list companies which allow working fully remotely** (e.g. you can work from anywhere in Portugal and you do not
have to set foot in an office if you don't want to). Some occasional traveling for onboarding, team building or similar
purposes is fine. Also the companies must also hire people using Portuguese full-time contracts (i.e. not self-employment).
For example, the following scenarios are OK:

* A completely Portuguese company that hires in Portugal with regular, non self-employed contracts people living in Portugal
* A foreign company, with a Portuguese legal entity to be able to hire people living in Portugal, using regular, non 
  self-employed contracts
* A foreign company, using an intermediary to hire people living in Portugal, but the contract must also be Portuguese,
  not requiring self-employment.

### Offers

Please provide a stable URL which lists all offers that meet the conditions for being listed in this page (or a simple 
way to filter/locate them). Recommendations:

* Not using an URL or page that seems to be for a specific offer (e.g. `/blog/backend_python_dev`). People browsing the
  list might not feel confident that the offer is still available and up to date
* Showing clearly when offers were posted
* Highlight clearly which offers fulfill the criteria for this listing or that all offers do. For instance, indicate
  clearly which offers are remote, etc.

## Adding a company

If you are a company or an individual, send a PR which adds the company to the list (in alphabetical order). Try to be
brief to keep the list manageable. Please make a note in the offer if:

* You have specific travel requirements (monthly onsites, etc.) which happen more than 3 times a year
* You require language knowledge other than Portuguese and/or medium English

or anything you feel might be important to users of the list, especially if this is not clearly stated in the offers in
your listings. Tag your offer with:

* (All offers are remote) if the job listing does not offer any indication that all offers are remote, nor marks clearly
  remote offers, but all jobs are remote.
* (All technical offers are remote) if the job listing does not offer any indication that all offers are remote, nor marks
  clearly remote offers, but all technical offers are remote.
* (View individual job offers to check for remote) if the job listing does not offer any indication that all offers are
  remote, nor marks clearly remote offers, so you need to check individual offers to see if the position is remote.
* (Async friendly)/(Async first) if you do not have specific availability requirements. This is especially interesting
  for workers who might be interested in working on a different schedule or timezone. You can also add details like 
  (Preferred overlap of 3 hours with US Eastern office hours), (Night shift every 4 weeks), (4 day week), or (Requires
  availability 8-9 Europe/Lisbon).

## Support
