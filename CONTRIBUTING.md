# Contributing

If you find something wrong or want to add another company please contribute with a pull request.

## Offers

Please provide a stable URL which lists all offers that meet the conditions for being listed in this page (or a simple 
way to filter/locate them). Recommendations:

* Not using an URL or page that seems to be for a specific offer (e.g. `/blog/backend_python_dev`). People browsing the
  list might not feel confident that the offer is still available and up to date
* Showing clearly when offers were posted
* Highlight clearly which offers fulfill the criteria for this listing or that all offers do. For instance, indicate
  clearly which offers are remote, etc.

## Adding a company

If you are a company or an individual, send a PR which adds the company to the list (in alphabetical order). Try to be
brief to keep the list manageable. Please make a note in the offer if:

* You have specific travel requirements (monthly onsites, etc.) which happen more than 3 times a year
* You require language knowledge other than Portuguese and/or medium English

or anything you feel might be important to users of the list, especially if this is not clearly stated in the offers in
your listings. Tag your offer with:

* (All offers are remote) if the job listing does not offer any indication that all offers are remote, nor marks clearly
  remote offers, but all jobs are remote.
* (All technical offers are remote) if the job listing does not offer any indication that all offers are remote, nor marks
  clearly remote offers, but all technical offers are remote.
* (View individual job offers to check for remote) if the job listing does not offer any indication that all offers are
  remote, nor marks clearly remote offers, so you need to check individual offers to see if the position is remote.
* (Async friendly)/(Async first) if you do not have specific availability requirements. This is especially interesting
  for workers who might be interested in working on a different schedule or timezone. You can also add details like 
  (Preferred overlap of 3 hours with US Eastern office hours), (Night shift every 4 weeks), (4 day week), or (Requires
  availability 8-9 Europe/Lisbon).

Thanks for contributing!
